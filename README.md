# Drum Machine 

This is part of a series of repos I've created to improve my knowledge of plain old (aka vanilla) Javascript. 
Without the use of JQuery or any other library, frameworks, or helpers, I attempted to build a simply "drum machine" that plays a sound when the user clicks on the corresponding key on his/her keyboard. 

Doing this, I learned the use of a couple of CSS tricks, such as the use of "transition" as well as got the chance to experiment with the "audio" tag, which I had not previously used.
